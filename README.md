# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Two Datasets

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements a **Fake News Detection System** using **two datasets (Fake and Real news)** to classify news articles as *Fake* or *Real*. The model is built using **Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning techniques**.

The project demonstrates a complete ML pipeline including **data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and prediction**, all implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
